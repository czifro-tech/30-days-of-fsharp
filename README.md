30 daily exercises for learning F#

Inspiration
===========

These exercises are ported from [30-day-of-elixir](https://github.com/kblake/30-days-of-elixir). The goal is to simply learn to program in F#. Since elixir and F# have a lot of similarities, it seemed like a good repo to base these exercises off of.

Motivation
==========

I am by no means an expert in F#. I am still learning the intricacies of F#. I will acknowledge that there maybe better implementations of these exercises, but this, for now, is my best attempt. My goal is to get comfortable enough with it for my Master's thesis.

Running
=======

This simply requires F# Interactive. FSI can load in any `.fsx` file, F# script. This allows you to more quickly see how your code works. FSI also allows you to write F# in the terminal, `let myName = "Bob";;`. Note the `;;`. FSI uses this to know when you are finished entering in F# code. This means you can enter multiple lines of code before FSI executes it. To run these scripts, do `#load "<nameOfScript>"`.
